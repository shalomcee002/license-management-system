# Frontend Documentation

This is the frontend part of the Fullstack Spring Boot and React application.

## Overview

The frontend is built using React and communicates with the backend Spring Boot application via API calls.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Contains React components used in the application.
- `src/services`: Contains functions for making API calls to the backend.
- `src/App.js`: The main component of the React application.
- `src/index.js`: The entry point for the React application.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## API Integration

The frontend interacts with the backend API. Ensure the backend server is running to test the frontend application.
